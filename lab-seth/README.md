## Features

TCP Chat Server is super easy to use and has just a few commands to keep it simple. It uses Winston Logger to keep track of logs.

## Code Example
```
    switch(commandWord){
    case'@list':
      socket.write(clients.map(client => client.name).join('\n') + '\n');
      break;
    case'@quit':
      socket.end();
      break;
    case'@nickname':
      if(!commandArgument1){
        socket.write('You must enter something after @nickname \n');
      }else{
        socket.write(`Your new name is: ${commandArgument1} \n`);
        for (let client of clients) { //vinicio - instead of doing clients[client] I can use directly client
          if (client !== socket)
            client.write(`${socket.name} has changed their name to ${commandArgument1} \n`);
        }
      }
      socket.name = commandArgument1;
      break;
    case'@dm':// seth - if(commandWord === '@dm') // USE LOOP through clients THAT ONLY GOES TO DM USER
      if (!commandArgument1) {
        socket.write('You must enter a <name> after @dm \n');
      }else if(!commandArgument2) {
        socket.write('You must enter a <message> after @dm <username> \n');
      } else {
        for (let client of clients) {
          if (client.name === commandArgument1){
            console.log('hitting clinet loop');
            client.write(`Direct Message from ${socket.name}: ${commandArgument2}`); //}
          }
        }
      }
      break;
    default:
      socket.write('Valid commands: @list, @quit, @nickname <new-name>, @dm <to-username> <message> \n');
      break;
    }
    return true;
```
